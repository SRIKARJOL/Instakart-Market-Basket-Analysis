# 1. Business Problem
A proper understanding of the business problem is the most crucial step for any machine learning or deep learning task. Let's try to understand the business problem first.
Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique that is very much helpful to increase sales, helps us to give a better understanding of customer purchasing techniques. Using the purchase history done over a period of time we try to suggest the items to the customer that could be reordered.
The major benefits would be an increase in sales and customer satisfaction. Using the data we try to determine the products that are brought together with which retailers can optimize product placement, they can provide better deals which would encourage the customers to purchase the items which they had not thought of buying. This would thus help increase sales. Market Basket analysis also allows companies to identify the important products and frequently purchased products which could potentially hurt their business if they are unavailable. For example, let's say we have predicted that so and so the product would be a part of these many users' next order. This would help the companies to be aware of the availability of the product and make sure it's available.
